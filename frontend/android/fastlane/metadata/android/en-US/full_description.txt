This is a client app for the self-hostable Plant-it Server (which can be found with the app's source repo). You will need to run/manage the server on your own in order to use the app.

Once set up, this app can be used for keeping track of plant care, receiving notifications about when to water plants, uploading plant images, and more.

<b>Features highlight:</b>
* Add existing plants or user created plants to your collection
* Log events like watering, fertilizing, biostimulating, etc. for your plants
* View all the logged events, filtering by plant and event type
* Upload photos of your plants
* Set reminder for some actions on your plants (e.g. notify if not watered every 4 days)
